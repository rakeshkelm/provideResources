Hi Charlotte and Susan,


If you would like to connect with me, I am available (aka at your convenience).


Thank you, for fighting poverty (aka via Gates Foundation) around the
planet. Thank you, also for sharing your email address at the website
(aka https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/leadership?division=Executive%20Leadership).
Thanks again, for receiving me at the website
(https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/leadership?division=Executive%20Leadership).


Food:
I am at the food pantry in the district, multiple times a day and
every day. It is a great way to communicate with neighbors and
visitors to the district, in addition to fulfilling one's thirst and
hunger. Unfortunately, it is unavailable multiple times a day and
every day and does not satisfy one's development needs.


Just so, I can communicate with someone, if you are busy and/or
unavailable, at the Gates Foundation. It would be delightful if you are able to
introduce me to any friends and/or acquaintances you may have.
Please, feel free to share their profiles and/or email addresses with
me. I have a preference for Resident friends/acquaintances (aka fresh
graduates who are in residence training). I also have a gender
preference - female (aka who have identified in the past, continue to
identify in the present and have reasonable - more likely than not -
confidence on their identity in the future). It would be excellent to
be able to perform conflict of interest and compatibility checks.


District:
I am energized by new relations. I am especially interested in
active partners. At the present time, I am available as a
partner for fighting poverty as both an open and/or a closed
partner, in addition to other partner activities. I have a preference for
Resident and/or open partners and I am unopposed to closed partners. It
would be fantastic if you are able to introduce me to partners (aka
banks, charities, foundations) and others of interest, that you may
know of.


Worklist:
I have a worklist that needs a Civil advocate (aka Case manager) and a
Patient advocate (aka Care manager). It would be wonderful if you are
able to connect me with both the Care manager and the Case manager.


Application:
Thank you, so much for allowing me to complete the partner application
provided at the website
(https://submit.gatesfoundation.org/tsk/30227897/flup/242043497/e/).
Please, feel comfortable in responding to the submitted application
and my email.


Funds:
I am ready to go live immediately with the capital I have in hand and
the potential for scaling a volunteer partner [aka Provide Resources,
(https://github.com/irakeshkelm), (https://github.com/rakeshkelm),
(https://github.com/rakeshkelmMedia)] is boundless. It would be a
superb match for the Gates Foundation.


Communications:
I use web applications for all my communications. A few are listed below. I am
also open to using ones you are comfortable with. It would be
marvelous if we can setup communications.


As always available, at your convenience.


Thank you,
Rakesh.
